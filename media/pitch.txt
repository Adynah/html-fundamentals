As I pivot into software engineering, I'm excited to combine my medical and technical expertise to design and develop innovative tools that enhance clinical research, diagnosis and patient care alongside foundational programming knowledge. I aim to hone essential technical skills, including RESTful API design, working with databases and building responsive UIs.
