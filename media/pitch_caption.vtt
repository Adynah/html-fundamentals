00:00:00.448 --> 00:00:02.450
As I pivot into software engineering,

2
00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:12.897
I'm excited to combine my medical and technical expertise to design and develop innovative tools that enhance clinical research,

00:00:13.518 --> 00:00:14.198
diagnosis,

4
00:00:14.458 --> 00:00:15.400
and patient care.

00:00:16.521 --> 00:00:19.443
Alongside foundational programming knowledge,

00:00:20.022 --> 00:00:25.608
I aim to hone essential technical skills, including restful API design,

7
00:00:26.128 --> 00:00:27.349
working with databases,

8
00:00:27.868 --> 00:00:29.890
and building responsive UIs.
